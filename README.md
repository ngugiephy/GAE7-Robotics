# TWO-WHEEL ROBOT CONTROL THROUGH A MOBILE APP

This project is controlling the movement of a two wheel differential drive through a mobile app


## INTRODUCTION

Remote robot control enables access to relatively inaccessible or otherwise dangerous environments for direct human intervention.
The focus of this project is to remotely control the speed and direction of a robot car. The robot is controlled by a  web app via phone or laptop.

## FUNCTIONALITY
Upon powerup/Activation/Powering, the user should be able to make the robot car move forward, backwards, and turn in any direction.
For wireless connectivity, an ESP-32 module is used in the robot circuit and the web app runs on any smart device which has internet capability.
The speed of the robot is varied by simultaneously stepping up the voltage fed into both motors controlling the wheels, whereas direction control is achieved by varying the speeds of the two motors independently.
